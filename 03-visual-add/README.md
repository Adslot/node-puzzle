# Visual Add

Design a efficient function that will take an array representing a positive integer (n) and return an array that represents (n + 1). An empty array should be considered as [0].

E.g.

- `[1]` would become [2]`
- `[1, 2]` represents number `12` so 'adding' `1` to it would be `13` or make it `[1, 3]`

### More examples

- `[1, 3, 6] -> [1, 3, 7]`
- `[0, 0, 5] -> [6]`
