# Visual Add

design a efficient function that will take an array representing a positive integer (n) and return an array that represents (n + 1). An empty array should be considered as [0]

e.g.

+ `[1]` would become `[2]`
+ `[1, 2]` represents number 12 so 'adding' 1 to it would make it `[1, 3]`

### some more examples
+ `[1, 3, 6]` -> `[1, 3, 7]`
+ `[0, 0, 5]` -> `[6]`
