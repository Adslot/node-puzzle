Modify methods encode/decode in "src/encoder.coffee".

Methods:
  encode: takes an array of booleans, returns an array of booleans
  decode: takes an array of booleans, returns an array of booleans

Modify these two methods so that if bits in the output of "encode" are flipped randomly,
with a particular probability, "decode" can still recover the original message passed to encode.
