# 08-cipher

## Setup

Assuming you have already installed [node](https://nodejs.org/),
install dependencies by running `npm install`.

## Tasks

1. Alphabet cipher

You're required to understand how basic alphabet cipher works. Create your encryption function based on the decryption function which is already crafted. Edit `lib/alphabet.coffee` file. To test your solution do `npm test` in your terminal and see output.

2. Offset (Caesar) cipher

This time it's even simpler - offset cipher. Based on the algorithm of encryption function you're required to write a decryption function. Edit `lib/offset.coffee` file. To test your solution do `npm test` in your terminal and see output.
